    abstract = {Colorization is a computer-assisted process of adding color to a monochrome image
or movie. The process typically involves segmenting images into regions and tracking
these regions across image sequences. Neither of these tasks can be performed reliably
in practice; consequently, colorization requires considerable user intervention and
remains a tedious, time-consuming, and expensive task.In this paper we present a simple
colorization method that requires neither precise image segmentation, nor accurate
region tracking. Our method is based on a simple premise; neighboring pixels in space-time
that have similar intensities should have similar colors. We formalize this premise
using a quadratic cost function and obtain an optimization problem that can be solved
efficiently using standard techniques. In our approach an artist only needs to annotate
the image with a few color scribbles, and the indicated colors are automatically propagated
in both space and time to produce a fully colorized image or sequence. We demonstrate
that high quality colorizations of stills and movie clips may be obtained from a relatively
modest amount of user input.},

     abstract={In this paper we study a first-order primal-dual algorithm for non-smooth convex optimization problems with known saddle-point structure. We prove convergence to a saddle-point with rate O(1/N) in finite dimensions for the complete class of problems. We further show accelerations of the proposed algorithm to yield improved rates on problems with some degree of smoothness. In particular we show that we can achieve O(1/N2) convergence on problems, where the primal or the dual objective is uniformly convex, and we can show linear convergence, i.e. O($\omega$N) for some $\omega$∈(0,1), on smooth problems. The wide applicability of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on several imaging problems such as image denoising, image deconvolution, image inpainting, motion estimation and multi-label image segmentation.},
